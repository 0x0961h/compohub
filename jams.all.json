Anyone interested in game development at all should come; team up with your newfound friends and make something amazing!\r\n\r\nMany from the local crowd are experienced developers, and will be working on their own projects or within their own teams for this event. But not everyone! You can team up with others, maybe learn a new skill, and jump on board with anyone that'll have you.\r\n\r\nBe sure to show up at the pre-event mixer to brainstorm ideas and team up with people that can show you the ropes!",

Make sure to prefix the thread title with [Entry]. If you drop out, please use the suffix [Dropout]. Once the entry is completed, please prefix with [Completed] and add a download link to the first post in your entry's thread. (If you don't have a place to host, I can host for you).\r\n\r\nThe thread title can be whatever- generally, people post the game title once they figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is the prize for winning?\r\nA: You get marked as the winner on the competition website! I know, exciting, right?\r\n(I'm open to Prize Ideas, given that they're cheap and not a lot of work. x)\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: How is the winner decided?\r\nA: Once the competition is over, everybody posts links to download their games. Any board member can vote for any finished entry (sometimes 1 or more votes per person), but we ask that if you are going to vote, you give every game a fair shake first.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What do I need to submit to be able to be voted on?\r\nA: You need to provide at least your game's binaries. Most of our members are Windows and Linux users, and some are Linux exclusive. It's up to you to decide what to provide binaries for, if someone can't play your game, you'll simply not get a vote from them.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to make your game Open Source and link to a repo, that's great, but not required. We'd still like to see some binaries, at least for Windows users. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What am I allowed to make my game with?\r\nA: Anything you like. You can use C++, C#, GameMaker, MMF, Flash, etc. So long as people can play your game to vote for it. It can even be a game mod, so long as it stands up as an original game, not just a re-skinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What are the team limits?\r\nA: You can work alone, or be on a team. We don't really have any hard limits on how many people can be in a team, since there usually aren't more than 3 for a competition game. If you feel like hiring 100 college students to produce your game, fine. It'll be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What can I do before the competition starts?\r\nA: You can work on your game engine, planning, design, art, etc. Pretty much anything but actual game-specific code.\r\n\r\nYou can also work on \"Prototype\" code ahead of time. For example, writing and testing out algorithms in programs. That's fine, but it can't really be actual game code.",

Fantastic Arcade invites its international guest developers to take part in a 48 hour game-building expo, incorporating a new \"Fantastic\" theme each year, with standout games to be shown off during the festival. In addition to the all-star developers taking part, we invite the global indie game community to take part at home. Gamemaking Frenzy games will be featured free on the BMO website, where everyone can play them and join in the discussion.\r\n\r\nGame Jams are already a vital part of indie game culture, with events like TIGjam, Ludum Dare, What Would Molydeux? and the Global Game Jam. The Gamemaking Frenzy operates in the same spirit of improvisational ingenuity and fun, not unlike the already wildly popular Filmmaking Frenzy competitions.\r\n\r\nThis years fantastic theme is Pendleton Ward's ADVENTURE TIME!\r\n\r\nFollow @fantasticarcade on Twitter to hear Gamemaking Frenzy updates as they are announced!",

We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to inspire a new generation of girls to get into coding and help women already in tech to become and discover new role models.    \r\n\r\nThe XX Game Jam will be on 26\/27 October as part of the London Games Festival (location tbc). The event will run from 6.30pm on Friday 26 October until 11pm, and then from 9am on 27 until 6.30pm on the Saturday 27 October. Food and refreshments will be provided on both days.  \r\n\r\nMen are welcome to support the event, come along and give support, and to come to the games showcase and prize ceremony on the Saturday evening from 6.30pm, but only women may participate. \r\n\r\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in taking part, apply for a place now. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for programmers, producers, artists, designers, sound designers and composers, and you can apply whether you have direct experience in the games industry or not.\r\n\r\nWhilst we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do our best to make sure you have a role to play, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guarantee that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a spot. We need to make sure that we have the right mix of skills for each team to have the best chance of success. We will confirm who has secured a place in plenty of time for the event. \r\n\r\nPlease sign up as an individual and not a team. You will be able to organise yourselves into teams on the Friday evening of the event, once everyone has introduced themselves and described their skill-set.\r\n\r\nThe theme for the games will be announced on the Friday.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking to put some funds in place to offer some assistance with travel, accommodation and childcare so let us know if any of these costs would be an impediment to you taking part.  \r\n\r\nContact debbie@aurochdigital.com for any other enquiries. Once you register, she will be contacting you with some questions about your skills. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis event is supported by Ukie, Ada Lovelace Day, DCRC@University of the West of England, London Games Festival, Next Gen Skills & Auroch Digital. ",

Make sure to prefix the thread title with [Entry]. If you drop out, please use the suffix [Dropout]. Once the entry is completed, please prefix with [Completed] and add a download link to the first post in your entry's thread. (If you don't have a place to host, I can host for you).\r\n\r\nThe thread title can be whatever- generally, people post the game title once they figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is the prize for winning?\r\nA: You get marked as the winner on the competition website! I know, exciting, right?\r\n(I'm open to Prize Ideas, given that they're cheap and not a lot of work. x)\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: How is the winner decided?\r\nA: Once the competition is over, everybody posts links to download their games. Any board member can vote for any finished entry (sometimes 1 or more votes per person), but we ask that if you are going to vote, you give every game a fair shake first.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What do I need to submit to be able to be voted on?\r\nA: You need to provide at least your game's binaries. Most of our members are Windows and Linux users, and some are Linux exclusive. It's up to you to decide what to provide binaries for, if someone can't play your game, you'll simply not get a vote from them.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to make your game Open Source and link to a repo, that's great, but not required. We'd still like to see some binaries, at least for Windows users. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What am I allowed to make my game with?\r\nA: Anything you like. You can use C++, C#, GameMaker, MMF, Flash, etc. So long as people can play your game to vote for it. It can even be a game mod, so long as it stands up as an original game, not just a re-skinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What are the team limits?\r\nA: You can work alone, or be on a team. We don't really have any hard limits on how many people can be in a team, since there usually aren't more than 3 for a competition game. If you feel like hiring 100 college students to produce your game, fine. It'll be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What can I do before the competition starts?\r\nA: You can work on your game engine, planning, design, art, etc. Pretty much anything but actual game-specific code.\r\n\r\nYou can also work on \"Prototype\" code ahead of time. For example, writing and testing out algorithms in programs. That's fine, but it can't really be actual game code.",

I know, exciting, right?\r\n(I'm open to Prize Ideas, given that they're cheap and not a lot of work. x)\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: How is the winner decided?\r\nA: Once the competition is over, everybody posts links to download their games. Any board member can vote for any finished entry (sometimes 1 or more votes per person), but we ask that if you are going to vote, you give every game a fair shake first.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What do I need to submit to be able to be voted on?\r\nA: You need to provide at least your game's binaries. Most of our members are Windows and Linux users, and some are Linux exclusive. It's up to you to decide what to provide binaries for, if someone can't play your game, you'll simply not get a vote from them.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to make your game Open Source and link to a repo, that's great, but not required. We'd still like to see some binaries, at least for Windows users. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What am I allowed to make my game with?\r\nA: Anything you like. You can use C++, C#, GameMaker, MMF, Flash, etc. So long as people can play your game to vote for it. It can even be a game mod, so long as it stands up as an original game, not just a re-skinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What are the team limits?\r\nA: You can work alone, or be on a team. We don't really have any hard limits on how many people can be in a team, since there usually aren't more than 3 for a competition game. If you feel like hiring 100 college students to produce your game, fine. It'll be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What can I do before the competition starts?\r\nA: You can work on your game engine, planning, design, art, etc. Pretty much anything but actual game-specific code.\r\n\r\nYou can also work on \"Prototype\" code ahead of time. For example, writing and testing out algorithms in programs. That's fine, but it can't really be actual game code.",

If you end up hosting TAG, you can handle it in any way you want under two conditions.\r\nYou must keep the 4 core rules outlined below by linking to this page. This maintains the legitimacy of the jam by identifying you officially as current host and prevents non-tagged people from hosting.\r\nThere must be 2 randomly generated themes, the last theme is chosen by you.\r\nOther than that you are free to decide how people join and how submissions are rated\/handled, and any further rules\/restrictions you want to place on participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 4 Core Rules\r\nSubmissions must come in within 12 hours of the Gamejam ending.\r\nSubmissions must be original works, no plagiarism.\r\nSubmissions can be based on any number of themes, but must incorporate at least 1 of the randomly generated themes.\r\nNo Pressure.

            "description": "What is TAG - The Arbitrary Gamejam?\r\nI created TAG to try and add something exciting and good natured to the community. \r\nThe Arbitrary Gamejam is a weekend game jam with 3 themes designed to promote small and unknown indie developers.\r\nAt the end of each TAG, the submissions are rated by the host.\r\nThe person who submitted the best game will be \"tagged\" and is responsible for hosting the next TAG.\r\nThe idea is, as the Gamejam grows more popular, passing the Gamejam around will help small unknown indie developers pull traffic to their websites.\r\nBy using a random word generator to generate 2\/3 themes, TAG is intentionally arbitrary to encourage outside-the-box thinking and wild combinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is TAG?\r\nTAG usually occurs on the first weekend of every month, Friday to Sunday.\r\nThe themes for each TAG will be posted on the Thursday before it starts, to give people some time to think about how the themes can fit together.\r\nThe Jam Begins at Midnight on Thursday and Ends at Midnight on Sunday.\r\n\r\n[Go to the Current Hosts site for a Countdown to the next TAG]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do I Host?\r\nFirst and foremost, you cannot host TAG twice in a row or more than two times in a single year (Unless yours is the only submission). If you end up hosting TAG, you can handle it in any way you want under two conditions.\r\nYou must keep the 4 core rules outlined below by linking to this page. This maintains the legitimacy of the jam by identifying you officially as current host and prevents non-tagged people from hosting.\r\nThere must be 2 randomly generated themes, the last theme is chosen by you.\r\nOther than that you are free to decide how people join and how submissions are rated\/handled, and any further rules\/restrictions you want to place on participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 4 Core Rules\r\nSubmissions must come in within 12 hours of the Gamejam ending.\r\nSubmissions must be original works, no plagiarism.\r\nSubmissions can be based on any number of themes, but must incorporate at least 1 of the randomly generated themes.\r\nNo Pressure. Just have fun with it. Submissions will still be accepted even if they're not complete.\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nTAG History\r\n\r\nA List of all previous TAGs, their hosts and their entries.\r\n\r\n#01 - August 2013 - Hosted by TickTakashi\r\n[Games]\r\n\r\n#02 - September 2013 - Hosted by Udell Games\r\n[Games]\r\n\r\n#03 - October 2013 - Hosted by Brendan LoBuglio\r\n[Not Yet Started]\r\n\r\n[TAG #03 Begins on October 11th]",

Part of the reason they're everywhere is that they're both well known and free to use, and a lot of people who make games aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware of just how many good stories they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re carrying around with them. There are SO MANY other stories and characters out there that are also free to use. The list goes on forever, and these are all stories that are free to be remixed and remade by anyone. Whatever the reason, a lot of these stories aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out there in games yet. SO LET'S MAKE SOME!",
