            "description": "Q: How do I enter?\r\nA: You have to be a member of the board; Register and then post in the Introduction Forum to get activated.\r\n\r\nFrom there, post a thread to this forum. Make sure to prefix the thread title with [Entry]. If you drop out, please use the suffix [Dropout]. Once the entry is completed, please prefix with [Completed] and add a download link to the first post in your entry's thread. (If you don't have a place to host, I can host for you).\r\n\r\nThe thread title can be whatever- generally, people post the game title once they figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is the prize for winning?\r\nA: You get marked as the winner on the competition website! I know, exciting, right?\r\n(I'm open to Prize Ideas, given that they're cheap and not a lot of work. x)\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: How is the winner decided?\r\nA: Once the competition is over, everybody posts links to download their games. Any board member can vote for any finished entry (sometimes 1 or more votes per person), but we ask that if you are going to vote, you give every game a fair shake first.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What do I need to submit to be able to be voted on?\r\nA: You need to provide at least your game's binaries. Most of our members are Windows and Linux users, and some are Linux exclusive. It's up to you to decide what to provide binaries for, if someone can't play your game, you'll simply not get a vote from them.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to make your game Open Source and link to a repo, that's great, but not required. We'd still like to see some binaries, at least for Windows users. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What am I allowed to make my game with?\r\nA: Anything you like. You can use C++, C#, GameMaker, MMF, Flash, etc. So long as people can play your game to vote for it. It can even be a game mod, so long as it stands up as an original game, not just a re-skinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What are the team limits?\r\nA: You can work alone, or be on a team. We don't really have any hard limits on how many people can be in a team, since there usually aren't more than 3 for a competition game. If you feel like hiring 100 college students to produce your game, fine. It'll be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What can I do before the competition starts?\r\nA: You can work on your game engine, planning, design, art, etc. Pretty much anything but actual game-specific code.\r\n\r\nYou can also work on \"Prototype\" code ahead of time. For example, writing and testing out algorithms in programs. That's fine, but it can't really be actual game code.",

My friends and I got all riled up on Twitter when talking about making games based on Magical Girls and I decided to make it official.\r\nWelcome to the Magical Girl Jam!\r\nWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Magical Girl?\r\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure what a Magical Girl even is or means then please visit the Resources page for links to example shows you can watch for free online.\r\nOr get lost in a TVTropes rabbit hole.\r\nWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a jam?\r\nGame jams are where game developers get together and within a specified time period (usually a single weekend or a week) they create a game from scratch based on the provided theme. This is a long jam, so you have until Halloween to figure out and make your entry.\r\nThis jam is not just limited to games!\r\nFeel free to work on any sort of craft you want to express your personal love of the Magical Girl genre. As long as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an original creation and not fan-art then it is totally acceptable for this. (I love fan-art but this jam is about creating new Magical Girls, a flood of Magical Girls!)\r\nThis jam is not just limited to girls or things starring girls!\r\n\"Magical Girl Jam\" is kind of a misnomer since that is what the genre is called. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve included an example of a Magical Boy show on the Resources page for inspiration. Please feel free to run with it!",

If you end up hosting TAG, you can handle it in any way you want under two conditions.\r\nYou must keep the 4 core rules outlined below by linking to this page. This maintains the legitimacy of the jam by identifying you officially as current host and prevents non-tagged people from hosting.\r\nThere must be 2 randomly generated themes, the last theme is chosen by you.\r\nOther than that you are free to decide how people join and how submissions are rated\/handled, and any further rules\/restrictions you want to place on participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 4 Core Rules\r\nSubmissions must come in within 12 hours of the Gamejam ending.\r\nSubmissions must be original works, no plagiarism.\r\nSubmissions can be based on any number of themes, but must incorporate at least 1 of the randomly generated themes.\r\nNo Pressure.
