Anyone interested in game development at all should come; team up with your newfound friends and make something amazing!\r\n\r\nMany from the local crowd are experienced developers, and will be working on their own projects or within their own teams for this event. But not everyone! You can team up with others, maybe learn a new skill, and jump on board with anyone that'll have you.\r\n\r\nBe sure to show up at the pre-event mixer to brainstorm ideas and team up with people that can show you the ropes!",

Make sure to prefix the thread title with [Entry]. If you drop out, please use the suffix [Dropout]. Once the entry is completed, please prefix with [Completed] and add a download link to the first post in your entry's thread. (If you don't have a place to host, I can host for you).\r\n\r\nThe thread title can be whatever- generally, people post the game title once they figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is the prize for winning?\r\nA: You get marked as the winner on the competition website! I know, exciting, right?\r\n(I'm open to Prize Ideas, given that they're cheap and not a lot of work. x)\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: How is the winner decided?\r\nA: Once the competition is over, everybody posts links to download their games. Any board member can vote for any finished entry (sometimes 1 or more votes per person), but we ask that if you are going to vote, you give every game a fair shake first.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What do I need to submit to be able to be voted on?\r\nA: You need to provide at least your game's binaries. Most of our members are Windows and Linux users, and some are Linux exclusive. It's up to you to decide what to provide binaries for, if someone can't play your game, you'll simply not get a vote from them.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to make your game Open Source and link to a repo, that's great, but not required. We'd still like to see some binaries, at least for Windows users. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What am I allowed to make my game with?\r\nA: Anything you like. You can use C++, C#, GameMaker, MMF, Flash, etc. So long as people can play your game to vote for it. It can even be a game mod, so long as it stands up as an original game, not just a re-skinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What are the team limits?\r\nA: You can work alone, or be on a team. We don't really have any hard limits on how many people can be in a team, since there usually aren't more than 3 for a competition game. If you feel like hiring 100 college students to produce your game, fine. It'll be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What can I do before the competition starts?\r\nA: You can work on your game engine, planning, design, art, etc. Pretty much anything but actual game-specific code.\r\n\r\nYou can also work on \"Prototype\" code ahead of time. For example, writing and testing out algorithms in programs. That's fine, but it can't really be actual game code.",

We need to make sure that we have the right mix of skills for each team to have the best chance of success. We will confirm who has secured a place in plenty of time for the event. \r\n\r\nPlease sign up as an individual and not a team. You will be able to organise yourselves into teams on the Friday evening of the event, once everyone has introduced themselves and described their skill-set.\r\n\r\nThe theme for the games will be announced on the Friday.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking to put some funds in place to offer some assistance with travel, accommodation and childcare so let us know if any of these costs would be an impediment to you taking part.  \r\n\r\nContact debbie@aurochdigital.com for any other enquiries. Once you register, she will be contacting you with some questions about your skills. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis event is supported by Ukie, Ada Lovelace Day, DCRC@University of the West of England, London Games Festival, Next Gen Skills & Auroch Digital. ",

            "description": "Q: How do I enter?\r\nA: You have to be a member of the board; Register and then post in the Introduction Forum to get activated.\r\n\r\nFrom there, post a thread to this forum. Make sure to prefix the thread title with [Entry]. If you drop out, please use the suffix [Dropout]. Once the entry is completed, please prefix with [Completed] and add a download link to the first post in your entry's thread. (If you don't have a place to host, I can host for you).\r\n\r\nThe thread title can be whatever- generally, people post the game title once they figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is the prize for winning?\r\nA: You get marked as the winner on the competition website! I know, exciting, right?\r\n(I'm open to Prize Ideas, given that they're cheap and not a lot of work. x)\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: How is the winner decided?\r\nA: Once the competition is over, everybody posts links to download their games. Any board member can vote for any finished entry (sometimes 1 or more votes per person), but we ask that if you are going to vote, you give every game a fair shake first.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What do I need to submit to be able to be voted on?\r\nA: You need to provide at least your game's binaries. Most of our members are Windows and Linux users, and some are Linux exclusive. It's up to you to decide what to provide binaries for, if someone can't play your game, you'll simply not get a vote from them.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to make your game Open Source and link to a repo, that's great, but not required. We'd still like to see some binaries, at least for Windows users. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What am I allowed to make my game with?\r\nA: Anything you like. You can use C++, C#, GameMaker, MMF, Flash, etc. So long as people can play your game to vote for it. It can even be a game mod, so long as it stands up as an original game, not just a re-skinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What are the team limits?\r\nA: You can work alone, or be on a team. We don't really have any hard limits on how many people can be in a team, since there usually aren't more than 3 for a competition game. If you feel like hiring 100 college students to produce your game, fine. It'll be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What can I do before the competition starts?\r\nA: You can work on your game engine, planning, design, art, etc. Pretty much anything but actual game-specific code.\r\n\r\nYou can also work on \"Prototype\" code ahead of time. For example, writing and testing out algorithms in programs. That's fine, but it can't really be actual game code.",
